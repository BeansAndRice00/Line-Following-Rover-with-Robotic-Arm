## Features

- **Rover Movement**: The rover can move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right.
- **Robotic Arm Control**: The robotic arm can be controlled to grab, lift, and release objects.
- **Line Following**: Incorporates sensors for line following, allowing the rover to autonomously follow lines.
- **Modular Design**: Easily expandable and customizable for additional functionalities.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback via a serial interface for debugging and monitoring.

## Hardware Components

- **mbed LPC1768**: The heart of the system, controls all functions.
- **DC Motors and Motor Drivers**: For rover movement.
- **Servo Motors**: For the robotic arm.
- **Line Following Sensors**: Typically infrared sensors.
- **Power Supply**: Batteries or external power source.
- **Chassis and Wheels**: Physical structure for the rover.

## Software Components

- **mbed OS**: Provides the operating system and hardware abstraction layer.
- **mbed APIs**: Libraries for motor control, sensor interfacing, and communication.
- **Control Algorithms**: Implementations for rover movement, arm control, and line following.
- **Serial Interface**: Communication protocol for real-time feedback and debugging.
- **Line Following Algorithm**: Determines rover behavior based on sensor input.
- **User Interface (optional)**: Implement a simple interface for manual control and status display.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup mbed Development Environment**: Install the mbed CLI or use the online compiler.
2. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/rover-robotic-arm-line-following.git`
3. **Compile and Flash**: Compile the code and flash it onto the LPC1768 board.
4. **Connect Hardware**: Assemble the hardware components and connect them to the mbed board.
5. **Power On**: Power on the system and observe the behavior.
6. **Interact**: Use the provided interface (if available) or monitor the serial output for feedback.
